## Compiling

### Windows (mingw-64):
You must have [mingw-64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/#mingw-builds) installed before trying to compile.
1. Put the `lib/libraylib.a` file found in the [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/download/3.7.0/raylib-3.7.0_win64_mingw-w64.zip) zip file into the `lib` folder.
2. Run `mingw32-make.exe build` to build the binary.

The compiled binary will be in the `build` folder.

### Other operating systems:
Have some knowledge on compiling source code and hope it works.
For reference you can try reading the [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) docs and see where that takes you.
